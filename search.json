    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2015-2019 Chicago Cubs had the potential to become a dynasty. After winning the 2016 World Series and reaching the National League Championship Series the year prior, the attention they were getting was impressive.\nThat roster consisted of several young MLB stars, including the names of Anthony Rizzo, Willson Contreras, Ben Zobrist, Kris Bryant and even Javier Báez. While each of those players were stars then, it’s become evident that many of their best seasons may be behind them.\nTwo players in particular were key players cogs in the Cubs lineup - Báez and Bryant. While in Chicago from 2015-2019, each player was essential to the team’s success. Kris Bryant won Rookie of the Year in 2015 and the Most Valuable Player award in 2016. However, the Cubs did not retain the star as his contract neared expiration. Javier Báez was in the same boat. He too starred on the Cubs and in 2018 finished second in the NL MVP voting, coming up just short to Christian Yelich of the Brewers.\nHowever, that was in the past. Today, Kris Bryant and Javier Báez play for different teams and struggle to have any impact on the game. After finding a lot of success inside of Wrigley Field, the two batters now find themselves well below average in several hitting metrics. The most noticeable of which – hitting for average.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nStats2015&lt;- read_csv(\"BaseballStats2015.csv\")|&gt; mutate(Season=2015, PlayerSeason=paste(Name, Season))\nStats2016&lt;-read_csv(\"BaseballStats2016.csv\")|&gt;

WAR indicates how much better a player is compared to their substitute. For this instance, Kris Bryant and Javier Báez proved to be some of the best players in baseball. While their WAR indicated their importance to the Cubs, there has been a stark cliff-dive from the two players since 2021.\nThe Cubs organization was scrutinized for not retaining either player before free agency. The Cubs later traded both of them at the 2021 trade deadline. However, now seeing the numbers, it’s clear how the Cubs got out at the right time.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=WARLeadersStacked, aes(x=reorder(Name, WAR), weight= WAR, fill=era)) +\n  geom_bar(data=JavyWAR, aes(x=reorder(Name, WAR), weight= WAR, fill=era), color=\"#CC3433\") +\n  geom_bar(data=KBWAR, aes(x=reorder(Name, WAR), weight= WAR, fill=era), color=\"#CC3433\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#0E3386\",\"darkgrey\"))+\ncoord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\nlabs(\n  x= \"Player\",\n    y= \"Combined WAR Total\",\n    title=\"WAR proves Báez and Bryant on the Cubs were amongst the best.\",\n    subtitle=\"When evaluating their WAR statistics, it's evident how good they were before the 2021\n  season. Now away from Chicago, each have struggled to have the same impact.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Noah Douglas\"\n)+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen compared to other star players, it becomes blatant that the former Cubs are not worth their excessive contracts. While Kris Bryant has had injury issues in Colorado and only played in 49 games in 2022, he still brought a negative WAR value to his team. Thus indicating that Rockies were better off without their big ticketed player valued at $27 million.\nBáez isn’t worth his contract either as he made $20 million to only have a 2.4 WAR and made $22 million to have a WAR value of 0.6. These metrics prove just how disappointing each have been the last few years.\n\n\nCode\nsalary&lt;- WARera|&gt;  filter(Name == \"Mookie Betts\" | Name == \"Bryce Harper\" | Name == \"Mike Trout\" | Name == \"Paul Goldschmidt\" | Name == \"Kris Bryant\" | Name== \"Javier Báez\" | Name== \"Shohei Ohtani\")|&gt;\n  filter(Season== \"2022\" | Season==\"2023\")|&gt;\n  select(PlayerSeason, WAR, Salary, Season, Name)\n\nsalary|&gt; \n  arrange(desc(WAR)) |&gt; \n  select(-PlayerSeason) |&gt;\n  select(Name, Season, WAR, Salary) |&gt; \n  gt()|&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Salary = \"Salary\",\n    WAR = \"WAR\",\n    Season = \"Season\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"WAR proves the former stars are not worth their contracts.\",\n    subtitle = \"Both Kris Bryant and Javier Báez have made over $18 million since 2022, but after being compared to other baseball stars, their WAR doesn't support their price.\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#CC3433\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Kris Bryant\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0E3386\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Javier Báez\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  )|&gt; tab_style (\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note= md(\"**By:** Noah Douglas | **Source:** Baseball Reference\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWAR proves the former stars are not worth their contracts.\n\n\nBoth Kris Bryant and Javier Báez have made over $18 million since 2022, but after being compared to other baseball stars, their WAR doesn't support their price.\n\n\nName\nSeason\nWAR\nSalary\n\n\n\n\nMookie Betts\n2023\n8.3\n$25416667\n\n\nPaul Goldschmidt\n2022\n7.7\n$26000000\n\n\nMookie Betts\n2022\n6.7\n$22916666\n\n\nMike Trout\n2022\n6.2\n$37116666\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\n2023\n6.0\n$30000000\n\n\nBryce Harper\n2023\n3.7\n$27538462\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\n2022\n3.4\n$5500000\n\n\nPaul Goldschmidt\n2023\n3.4\n$26000000\n\n\nMike Trout\n2023\n2.9\n$37116667\n\n\nBryce Harper\n2022\n2.5\n$27538461\n\n\nJavier Báez\n2022\n2.4\n$20000000\n\n\nJavier Báez\n2023\n0.6\n$22000000\n\n\nKris Bryant\n2022\n0.4\n$18000000\n\n\nKris Bryant\n2023\n-1.0\n$28000000\n\n\n\nBy: Noah Douglas | Source: Baseball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Rockies and Tigers pray their “star” players return to their Chicago values, it is clear the Cubs avoided disaster in letting the fan-favorites walk away."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks have an interesting challenge on their hands, keeping Superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo happy. The way to make Giannis happy however is through one thing – winning.\nGiannis made it clear following the 2021 NBA Championship win that he wanted more titles. He understood that winning one title wasn’t enough and he is hungry for more. As Giannis is 28 and losing his prime years of athleticism, the Bucks are doing everything in their power to secure more opportunities at title runs. The first thing being the head coaching position.\nHowever, after a stunning loss in the first round of the 2023 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat, the Bucks made the decision to let go of their NBA Championship winning coach in Mike Budenholzer. While Budenholzer often took a lot of scrutiny for lack of defensive adjustments and falling flat as the highest seed in the Eastern Conference, the Bucks made the change to go to rookie head coach, Adrian Griffin.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nstandings&lt;-read_csv(\"rankingsbydate.csv\")\nbucksplace&lt;-standings|&gt; filter(Team==\"MIL\")\nbucks&lt;-read_csv(\"bucks.csv\")\nplayersgood&lt;-read_csv(\"select24.csv\")\nteamstats&lt;-read_csv(\"teamstats.csv\")\nbuckscoaches&lt;-read_csv(\"buckscoaches.csv\")\n\nrecords&lt;-buckscoaches |&gt;\n  group_by(Coach)|&gt;\n  select(Coach, W, L)|&gt;\n  filter(Coach==\"Mike Budenholzer\" | Coach==\"Adrian Griffin\" | Coach==\"Doc Rivers\")|&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Wins= sum(W),\n    Losses= sum(L)\n  )\ncoaches&lt;-buckscoaches |&gt;\n  group_by(Coach)|&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Wins= sum(W),\n    Losses= sum(L)\n  )\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=coaches,\n    aes(y=Coach, x=Losses, xend=Wins),\n    size= 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\")+\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=records,\n    aes(y=Coach, x=Losses, xend=Wins))+\n   labs(\n    title=\"Milwaukee Bucks' head coach records\", \n    subtitle = \"The Bucks are paying three head coaches for &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;wins&lt;/span&gt; yet, the new coach has recorded more &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt; than wins.\",\n    caption = \"By: Noah Douglas Source: Basketball Reference\",\n    x=\"Coaching Record\"\n  ) +\n    theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Bucks enjoyed a stunning successful stretch with their new coach at the helm. In Griffin’s time with the Bucks, they managed a 30-13 record and were in the race for first place in the East. With the offense clicking and the wins coming it seemed like the Bucks were ready to compete and make a run deep into the playoffs. However, Giannis felt this head coach wasn’t it. Along with other star players on the Bucks, there wasn’t a strong enough voice from Griffin leaving the players with enough confidence to sustain the success. Thus, the stunning move to fire Adrian Griffin was made.\nOnce Adrian Griffin was fired, the Bucks turned to veteran head coach Doc Rivers to lead the team to the playoffs. However, the journey wasn’t as easy as initially thought. The transition from the two coaches was rough as the offensive efficiency numbers fell and the defensive numbers only slightly improved.\nThe Bucks scuffled with Rivers at the helm and the Bucks snuck their way into a three seed in the playoffs, the lowest they had been in the previous four seasons. Doc Rivers led the Bucks to a 19-20 record the rest of the way. Griffin had the Bucks firmly in second, meanwhile the Bucks bounced around after Rivers arrived.\n\n\nCode\ngriffin&lt;-standings|&gt;\n  filter(Date&lt;=as.Date(\"2024-01-23\"))\nrivers&lt;-standings|&gt;\n  filter(Date&gt;=as.Date(\"2024-01-29\"))\n\ngriffinerabucks&lt;-griffin|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"MIL\")\n\ngriffineraceltics&lt;-griffin|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"BOS\")\n\ngriffineraKnicks&lt;-griffin|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"NYK\")\n\ngriffinerateams&lt;- bind_rows(griffinerabucks, griffineraceltics, griffineraKnicks)\n\nriverserabucks&lt;-rivers|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"MIL\")\n\nriverseraceltics&lt;-rivers|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"BOS\")\n\nriverseraknicks&lt;-rivers|&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"NYK\")\n\nriverserateams&lt;- bind_rows(riverserabucks, riverseraceltics, riverseraknicks)\n\nbump1&lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=griffin, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_point(data=griffin, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bump(data=griffinerabucks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#00471B\")+\n  geom_point(data=griffinerabucks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#00471B\")+\n    geom_bump(data=griffineraceltics, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#007A33\")+\n  geom_point(data=griffineraceltics, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#007A33\")+\n  geom_bump(data=griffineraKnicks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#F58426\")+\n  geom_point(data=griffineraKnicks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#F58426\")+\n   geom_text(data = griffinerateams |&gt; filter(Date == min(Date)), aes(x = Date - 1.5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = griffinerateams |&gt; filter(Date == max(Date)), aes(x = Date + 1.5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(x=\"Adrian Griffin\")\n\nbump2&lt;-ggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data=rivers, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_point(data=rivers, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bump(data=riverserabucks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#00471B\")+\n  geom_point(data=riverserabucks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#00471B\")+\n    geom_bump(data=riverseraceltics, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#007A33\")+\n  geom_point(data=riverseraceltics, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#007A33\")+\n  geom_bump(data=riverseraknicks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank), color=\"#F58426\")+\n  geom_point(data=riverseraknicks, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, size=.5), color=\"#F58426\")+\n   geom_text(data = riverserateams |&gt; filter(Date == min(Date)), aes(x = Date - 1.5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = riverserateams |&gt; filter(Date == max(Date)), aes(x = Date + 1.5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(x=\"Doc Rivers\")\n\n bump1/bump2 +\n   plot_annotation(\n    title = \"A successful rookie coach canned for a seasoned veteran coach\",\n    subtitle = \"The Bucks were 30-13 before firing Adrian Griffin.

The Bucks traded for star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard and Giannis combining were expected to become a dynamic duo, however, that was simply not the case.\nThe shot efficiency for Giannis skyrocketed in a historic offensive season for him in 2024, however, Lillard was affected by the new coaching style. Along with another big-time player in Khris Middleton, getting healthier, the Bucks had a core group that was ready to compete.\nHowever, the player drop offs were noticeable. Lillard’s efficiency dropped, the absence of Jrue Holiday being traded away hurt the Bucks, and even injuries later in the season effected the the Bucks.

The Bucks later lost in the first round to the Indiana Pacers and while Dame was hurt at points in the series and Giannis didn’t play at all, Rivers was not the coach for the job. It became clear that either sticking with Coach Budenholzer or riding it out for the entirety of the season with Griffin would have been a better move."
