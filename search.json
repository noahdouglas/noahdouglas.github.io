    "text": "The 2015-2019 Chicago Cubs had the potential to become a dynasty. After winning the 2016 World Series and reaching the National League Championship Series the year prior, the attention they were getting was impressive.\nThat roster consisted of several young MLB stars including the names of Anthony Rizzo, Willson Contreras, Ben Zobrist, Kris Bryant and even Javier Báez. While each of those players were stars then, it’s become evident that many of their best seasons may be behind them.\nTwo players in particular were key players cogs in the Cubs lineup - Javier Báez and Kris Bryant. While in Chicago from 2015-2019, each player was essential to the team’s success. Kris Bryant won Rookie of the Year in 2015 and the Most Valuable Player award in 2016. However, the Cubs did not retain the star as his contract neared expiration. Javier Báez was in the same boat. He too starred on the Cubs and in 2018 finished second in the NL MVP voting, coming up just short to Christian Yelich of the Brewers.\nHowever, that was in the past. Today, Kris Bryant and Javier Báez play for different teams and struggle to have any impact on the game. After finding a lot of success inside of Wrigley Field, the two batters now find themselves well below average in several hitting metrics. The most noticeable of which – hitting for average.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nStats2015&lt;- read_csv(\"BaseballStats2015.csv\")|&gt; mutate(Season=2015, PlayerSeason=paste(Name, Season))\nStats2016&lt;-read_csv(\"BaseballStats2016.csv\")|&gt;

WAR indicates how much better than player is compared to their replacement. For this instance, Kris Bryant and Javier Báez proved to be some of the best players in baseball. While their WAR indicated their importance to the Cubs from 205-2019, there has been a stark cliff-dive from the two players since 2021.\nThe Cubs organization was scrutinezed for not retaining either player before free agnecy before ultimately trading them boht at the 2021 trade deadline in July. However, now seeing the numbers, it’s clear how the Cubs got out of two bad contracts.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=WARLeadersStacked, aes(x=reorder(Name, WAR), weight= WAR, fill=era)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#0E3386\",\"#CC3433\"))+\ncoord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\nlabs(\n  x= \"Player Name\",\n    y= \"Combined WAR Total\",\n    title=\"Báez and Bryant on the Cubs were amongst the best.\",\n    subtitle=\"When evaluating their WAR statistics, it's evident how good they were before the 2021\n  season. Now away from Chicago, each have struggled to have the same impact.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Noah Douglas\"\n)+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs organization was scrutinezed for not retaining either player before free agnecy before ultimately trading them boht at the 2021 trade deadline in July. However, now seeing the numbers, it’s clear how the Cubs got out of two bad contracts. When compared to other star players, it becomes blatant that the two players are not worth their money whatsoever. While Kris Bryant has had injury issues in Colorado and only played in 49 games in 2022, he still brought a negative WAR value to his team. Thus indicating that Rockies were better off without their big ticketed player valued at $27 million.\nBáez isn’t worth his contract either as he made $20 million to only have a 2.4 WAR and made $22 million to have a WAR value of 0.6. These metrics prove just how disappointing each have been the last few years.\n\n\nCode\nsalary&lt;- WARera|&gt;  filter(Name == \"Mookie Betts\" | Name == \"Bryce Harper\" | Name == \"Mike Trout\" | Name == \"Paul Goldschmidt\" | Name == \"Kris Bryant\" | Name== \"Javier Báez\" | Name== \"Shohei Ohtani\")|&gt;\n  filter(Season== \"2022\" | Season==\"2023\")|&gt;\n  select(PlayerSeason, WAR, Salary, Season, Name)\n\nsalary|&gt; \n  arrange(desc(WAR)) |&gt; \n  select(-PlayerSeason) |&gt;\n  select(Name, Season, WAR, Salary) |&gt; \n  gt()|&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Salary = \"Salary\",\n    WAR = \"WAR\",\n    Season = \"Season\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Kris Bryant and Javier Báez are not worth their contracts.\",\n    subtitle = \"Each player has made over $18 million since 2022, but after being compared to other baseball stars, their WAR doesn't support their price.\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0E3386\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Kris Bryant\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0E3386\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Javier Báez\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  )|&gt; tab_style (\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note= md(\"**By:** Noah Douglas | **Source:** Baseball Reference\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKris Bryant and Javier Báez are not worth their contracts.\n\n\nEach player has made over $18 million since 2022, but after being compared to other baseball stars, their WAR doesn't support their price.\n\n\nName\nSeason\nWAR\nSalary\n\n\n\n\nMookie Betts\n2023\n8.3\n$25416667\n\n\nPaul Goldschmidt\n2022\n7.7\n$26000000\n\n\nMookie Betts\n2022\n6.7\n$22916666\n\n\nMike Trout\n2022\n6.2\n$37116666\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\n2023\n6.0\n$30000000\n\n\nBryce Harper\n2023\n3.7\n$27538462\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\n2022\n3.4\n$5500000\n\n\nPaul Goldschmidt\n2023\n3.4\n$26000000\n\n\nMike Trout\n2023\n2.9\n$37116667\n\n\nBryce Harper\n2022\n2.5\n$27538461\n\n\nJavier Báez\n2022\n2.4\n$20000000\n\n\nJavier Báez\n2023\n0.6\n$22000000\n\n\nKris Bryant\n2022\n0.4\n$18000000\n\n\nKris Bryant\n2023\n-1.0\n$28000000\n\n\n\nBy: Noah Douglas | Source: Baseball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Rockies and Tigers pray their “star” players return to their Chicago numbers, it is clear the Cubs avoided disaster in paying for either of these fan-favorites."
